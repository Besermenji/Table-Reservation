# Contributing

## I love you

Thanks so much for wanting to contribute to Authority! You are wonderful and I love you.

## New feature? Probably not.

Authority's default answer to new features is "no".

Every feature increases the complexity of Authority. It will need documentation, tests, and maintenance. Its interactions with other features will forever need to be considered. More code means more chances for bugs.

Every feature makes Authority harder to understand for users and maintainers.

A feature **must clearly benefit most users** to justify these costs.

It's hard to reject pull requests. It feels like rejecting the requester personally. But the silent participants in the conversation must be considered, too: all the other users and maintainers. Every user of Authority has entrusted us to put code into their system. **We owe it to them not to add needless complexity**.

If your feature seems worth the tradeoff, great! But be aware that the bar is high.

## Bugfixes welcome

Bugfixes, updating deprecated method calls, etc are always welcome.

## Tests and readability

No untested code will be accepted. No confusing code will be accepted. (Yes, that's subjective.) Make it as readable as you possibly can.
